                It all started in a small town in Iowa. I first started to gain interest in 
                computer programming because my freshman math teacher told the class that if 
                we completed an introduction to an online coding program on Khan Academy that 
                we could get some extra credit. I ended up falling in love with the coding, 
                completed the entire online program on my own accord, and still wanted more.

                A few years later I was starting my first year at Iowa State University studying 
                software engineering. After not too long, I found that program to be 
                way to broad for what I wanted to study. However, I did come away from ISU with 
                a better understanding of what major I wanted to pursue.

                <span class="thirdpara">
                Throughout my time at Iowa State, I also learned a lot about how much I enjoyed 
                serving in the military. I had enlisted in the Army National Guard as a junior 
                in high school. I couldn't get away from the idea that I wanted to do something 
                more than just the weekend drills I was doing each month with the National Guard.
                When I started up at Utah Valley University, I also decided to join the Air Force 
                ROTC program. Now I have a job set aside for me as a Combat Systems Officer once 
                I graduate.

                <span class="fourthpara">
                I hope to apply what I learned through my degree to my Air Force career, yet even 
                if I can't find a way for the two paths to intertwine, I will still be using what 
                I have learned throughout my education. I hope to create websites as a side project 
                for myself while I am an officer in the Air Force. I know that I find a lot of joy 
                through making websites, so I would see it more as doing what I love than just some 
                extra work. Plus, I will be able to keep myself competitive in my civilian career 
                skills if I continue to create websites while I am serving.
