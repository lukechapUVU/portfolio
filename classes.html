        <p class="dgm1220-desc">Web Design and Development is meant to teach the fundamentals of digital layout for web 
            development and how to properly create engaging interfaces for digital media. It also covers how 
            to address technical challenges for digital mediums to deliver effective digital experiences. Lastly, 
            it introduces basic content creation and sprint thinking independent of software platforms. My 
            first experiences in the Web Design and Development were an interesting eye-opening for me. 
            I never considered myself to be much of the artistic type, so when I found out that I would actually 
            have to take design classes I really was not sure what to think. However, in my Digital Design 
            Essentials class, I not only had the guidance from my professor and the 
            courses learning objectives, but I also had the freedom to explore Adobe 
            Illustrator which was the main software that I used for my designs. 
            Although I learned a lot of things about designing, I wouldn't consider 
            myself better at designing than an actual designer. I would say that this 
            class gave me a interest towards design that I did not know I had. I found 
            myself asking friends and family if they knew of any people who needed 
            logo designs for anything because I wanted some sort of project to work 
            on with these newfound tools I discovered.

        <h4 class="dgm1600-header">Scripting for Internet Tech</h4>
        <img class="dgm1600-img" src="imgs/dgm1600.png" alt="DGM 1600">
        <p class="dgm1600-desc">Another class that I took my first semester here at UVU was a little more familiar 
            to me than the design class I was taking. Scripting for Internet Tech's learning 
            objectives are to learning how to write code using JavaScript as well as a small 
            amount of HTML markup and CSS layout. It also introduces the fundamentals 
            of Git for source code version control and project collaboration. This class did
            exactly what it said it would. It taught me how to write HTML, CSS, and JS along 
            with other web development skills. I had a lot of fun during this class learning 
            about how to access APIs using JSON and taking the data from those APIs to 
            create cards that can flip with more details on the back. What I learned about 
            Git in this class wasn't really too clear to me at the time, but I was excited to 
            learn more about what it had to offer and why it was considered to be so 
            important.            
        </p>
        <h4 class="dgm2120-header">Web Essentials</h4>
        <img class="dgm2120-img" src="imgs/dgm2120.png" alt="DGM 2120">
        <p class="dgm2120-desc">Web Essentials was another class I took at the start of my time at UVU, and it taught 
            exactly what it sounds like: web essentials. This was really my first class where I had 
            to create a website from the ground up with full navigation and interactive elements. 
            I developed multiple different web pages and linked them all together through a 
            navigation menu bar. I learned different skills like creating forms, inserting embedded 
            elements like videos, and formatting figure which contain images and caption. As you 
            can tell from the couple of screenshots that I placed to the right, I'm a better developer 
            than a designer. I'm not exactly sure what past Luke was thinking about with having a 
            mix between salmon and pink as the background color for that form, but present Luke 
            can definitely tell an eye-sore when he sees one. Looking back on this, it seems like I 
            have come a long way from there, so hopefully that is right.

        <h4 class="dgm1230-header">Digital Design Essentials</h4>
        <img class="dgm1230-img" src="imgs/dgm1230.png" alt="DGM 1230">
        <p class="dgm1230-desc">In my second semester I started to get a little more into website 
            design rather than just the logo and small element designs that I 
            learned and practiced in the Digital Design Essentials class I took in 
            the semester prior to this one. Interaction Design Essentials was the 
            name of this class, and one of the core principles that I worked on 
            in this class was the web design column grid layout which usually 
            utilized 12 columns. I found a local non-profit's website and did 
            my best to redesign it. I say that I did my best because design is 
            still not a strong suit of mine. Throughout this course I definitely 
            struggled with using proper fonts as well as putting together good 
            color palettes for the site. I learned a lot about using fonts better 
            and finding better color palettes, but I still think that my designs 
            aren't really much to brag about. I guess it's a good thing that I 
            like developing rather than designing.

        <h4 class="dgm2250-header">Principles of Digital Design</h4>
        <img class="dgm2250-img" src="imgs/dgm2250.png" alt="DGM 2250">
        <p class="dgm2250-desc">Principles of Digital Design was all about learning about the process behind 
            implementing an interactive and exciting new application. The class introduced 
            me to a number of different team-based idea sharing strategies as well as 
            how to use these strategies to come up with a design in a way other than just 
            going with the first thing that comes to mind. Principles of Digital Design also 
            covered what it was like to be responsible for proper time management and 
            how to report your work and progress in your project through weekly sprint 
            reports. This was an interesting class for me to learn from because prior to 
            taking this class, I already had some experience with working in teams that 
            had sprint meetings and sometimes even found myself doing projects in 
            these teams which required idea-building exercises such as the ones I 
            learned about in this class. Because of this, I found it very interesting to learn 
            the academic side of the real-world application that I already had some 
            experience with.

        <h4 class="dgm2341-header">Media Formats and Outputs</h4>
        <img class="dgm2341-img" src="imgs/dgm2341.png" alt="DGM 2341">
        <p class="dgm2341-desc">Another class that I was taking in my second semester was Media 
            Formats and Outputs. This class taught me about the different file 
            types that are common in audio, visual, video, and sound. I learned 
            about what file types are good for which applications and how the 
            quality of some file types is either lost when compressed or how 
            well that quality is reserved. I also did a deep dive into looking at 
            how the size of the files changes based on the file type and how 
            much compression took place. The visual aspects of the file types 
            and compression that I learned about was the most interesting to 
            me. Just like audio, video, and sound, visual file types and 
            compression can either be lossy or lossless which means either 
            that some quality was lost in the compression or it wasn't. One 
            thing interesting about visual file types was the difference 
            between raster and vector though. Raster is pixel based and 
            loses sharpness when scaling the image up or down, 
            whereas vector imaging is made up of mathematical paths 
            and can be easily scaled up or down without losing sharpness.

        <h4 class="dgm2760-header">Web Languages I</h4>
        <img class="dgm2760-img" src="imgs/dgm2760.png" alt="DGM 2760">
        <p class="dgm2760-desc">In Web Languages I, another class I took my second semester, I got 
            really good at putting my work into GitHub. I learned a number of 
            different skills such as using the math library, manipulating the DOM 
            through JavaScript, handling errors, and manipulating string objects. 
            I had done some work with GitHub before, but I never really understood 
            the benefits of using it. However, after this class, I started to realize 
            just how much of an asset it is when you are working on code. The 
            crazy thing is that I was just working by myself in my Git repository, and 
            the tools I was using can prove much more useful when I start working 
            in a team. This course also really taught me a lot about how JavaScript 
            can be used to enhance the experience that you are able to give your 
            users on a website.

        <h4 class="dgm1240-header">Communicating Digital Design</h4>
        <img class="dgm1240-img" src="imgs/dgm1240.png" alt="DGM 1240">
        <p class="dgm1240-desc">One of the classes that I took my third semester here at UVU was 
            called Communicating Digital Design. This class was for my Writing 
            Enriched graduation requirement, so I knew that it the bane of my 
            existence would be coming with this class: writing. I thought that 
            it would be understood that since I decided to go with a coding 
            major that my programming would speak enough for itself... I guess 
            not. Nonetheless, this class really wasn't as bad as I anticipated it to be. 
            I think that since the subject interested me I was able to get through the 
            writing much easier. This class aimed to teach me a few soft skills 
            like managing time and resources and communicating, as well as some 
            hard skills like visualizing good designs and design principles and utilizing 
            design softwares such as Adobe XD and Adobe InDesign. This class gave 
            me an interesting skill that it didn't list in its course outline though which 
            was the skill to critically evaluate designs and UI elements that I see often
            and think how I could incorporate similar tactics or themes into my own 
            designs. I also spent some time in this class researching my desired career 
            field and writing application materials like a cover letter and resume.

        <h4 class="dgm221r-header">Interaction Design Practicum</h4>
        <img class="dgm221r-img" src="imgs/dgm221r.png" alt="DGM 221R">
        <p class="dgm221r-desc">It wasn't really until this class in my third semester that I really 
            started to experience what it was like to work on a development 
            team. I would also be working in an entirely new environment 
            that I was not familiar or comfortable with. Interaction Design 
            Practicum was the name of the class, and it really taught me a 
            lot. Not only did I have to work within a team for the first time, 
            but I also had to take into account the considerations from the 
            client we were doing the development for. Tack onto those 
            challenges another one because I also was working within 
            WordPress for the first time. It wasn't at all what I was familiar 
            with which was the freedoms of coding something from scratch.
            There were some hurdles that I jumped in this class. There was 
            also some great lessons that I learned from this class. In the end 
            though, I was proud of the progress that me and my teammate 
            made on the website and I hope to revisit the site a few years 
            later and see it the way that my client intends it to look.

        <h4 class="dgm312g-header">Digital Media For Intercultural Communications</h4>
        <img class="dgm312g-img" src="imgs/dgm312g.png" alt="DGM 312G">
        <p class="dgm312g-desc">My third semester also included a course that I wasn't 
            too sure about what to expect from at first. Digital 
            Media For Intercultural Communications stated in its 
            syllabus that upon completion of the course, I would 
            be able to analyze and evaluate global or intercultural 
            issues, discuss stereotypical cultural conceptions and 
            recognize the complexity and variety of different cultural groups, identify tools, 
            technologies, and development practices that enable accessibility to digital
            materials, as well as many other course objectives that were listed. That sounds 
            like a lot to a student who was planning on a lot more coding than reading 
            and writing. What I learned from this course I think cannot be comparable to 
            learning another programming language or skill though. Prior to this class, I 
            hadn't realized how I often went into developing a website with the mindset of 
            all of the users being just like me. I am glad that I took this class because it helped 
            me understand how there are considerations that I need to take as the creator of 
            a product. After taking this class, I now understand that accessibility is more than 
            just one of the options in the settings you find in a video game menu screen.

        <h4 class="dgm310r-header">Digital Lecture Series</h4>
        <img class="dgm310r-img" src="imgs/dgm310r.png" alt="DGM 310R">
        <p class="dgm310r-desc">What's a great way to learn more about digital media and how to 
            better market yourself to companies or your designs to your 
            audience? Why not learn from some professionals in your field? 
            Honestly, I am still baffled at how many connections the Digital 
            Media department at UVU has. There are some amazing titans from 
            the Digital Media world that either trace their roots back to UVU or 
            have connected to the department in some other way. The Digital 
            Lecture Series class was a great experience. There were so many 
            great topics that were covered throughout the semester in this class 
            by so many amazing speakers. At the very least I learned a little bit 
            more about how to do effective presentations since it seemed like 
            all of the guest speakers we had were Ted Talk gurus themselves. At 
            most I learned how to impress future employers, work hard in my 
            career field, and create compelling designs that help my work stand 
            out from the crowd.

        <img class="dgm2740-img" src="imgs/dgm2740.png" alt="DGM 2740">
        <p class="dgm2740-desc">Principles of Web Languages was the last class that I 
            took in my third semester at UVU. This course was 
            meant to teach how to build responsive layouts, 
            implement a SASS CSS preprocessor, demonstrate 
            various navigation techniques for all screen sizes, as 
            well as many other learning objectives. I would 
            definitely agree with the responsive layout portion of 
            that list because that was something that was always 
            in the back of my head when writing the code for these 
            sites. Using a SASS CSS preprocessor was new to me in 
            this class, but it was a welcome introduction. I really 
            enjoyed writing code in an SCSS file and seeing it then 
            populate in my CSS file, that is, when the preprocessor 
            wasn't deciding to randomly go down. I think that in 
            this class I started to notice some improvements to my 
            design at least compared to the web essentials class 
            that I took a few semesters back.

        <h4 class="dgm2240-header">Interaction Design</h4>
        <img class="dgm2240-img" src="imgs/dgm2240.png" alt="DGM 2240">
        <p class="dgm2240-desc">This semester I took a class called Interaction Design. The course 
            objectives for this class included recognizing and utilizing 
            important interaction design terms, practices, principles, and 
            strategies, conduct a simple usability study, design and create a 
            prototype, and test the prototype, and participate effectively as a 
            team member in team design activities among other things. The 
            client that we worked with in this class was the First-Year Advising 
            Center at UVU. As you can see on the right, there were complete 
            overhauls that we did to their site, especially the landing page. 
            We learned about the process of putting together a design. 
            We started with audience observations, surveys, and asking 
            ourselves the basic questions of what we want the site to achieve. 
            After that we moved to putting together skeleton designs, 
            wireframes, and surface compositions. After all of that work we 
            put together a final design and presented it to our client. Much of 
            what I learned from this class came from working with my team 
            though. Sure there were design principles that we put into practice, 
            but exercising communicating skills and experiencing the challenges 
            and benefits of working in a team were the big takeaways for me.

        <h4 class="dgm3740-header">Web Content Management</h4>

        <p class="dgm3740-desc">Web Content Management was another course that I 
            took this semester. The syllabus stated that at the end 
            of this course I should know how to install WordPress 
            manually, build a responsive HTML theme using a CSS 
            preprocessor and SASS, use PHP and JavaScript to build 
            a multipage site, upload using FTP to a real web server, 
            and much more. I don't think that I can characterize 
            what I learned in this class better. This course taught me 
            how to use PHP, FTP, and WordPress and the advantages 
            of using such tools/languages. I think that if I were to 
            have taken this class before Interaction Design Practicum 
            I would have felt a lot more comfortable with working in 
            WordPress and maybe would have been able to get some 
            more done for my client at the time especially if I would 
            have known how to make my own WordPress plugin. 
            I have no doubt that the skills that I learned in this class 
            will help me in my future career with website development.

        <p class="mktg3960-desc">The last class that I've taken so far that I'll talk about is Digital 
            Marketing Analytics. In this class I had the opportunity to 
            obtain Google certifications in Google Analytics, apply 
            advanced digital marketing skills in evaluating companies' 
            marketing efforts, critique digital marketing decisions based 
            on web analytics metrics, and gain a systematic understanding 
            of digital marketing analytics concepts. Classes prior to this 
            talked about what could be done to a design or the 
            functionality of a site whether through UI elements or other 
            design principles, but they never really covered how you could 
            know if you were doing well in attracting an audience to your 
            site and more importantly keeping them there and getting them 
            to interact with the site. This class taught me how to measure 
            those dimensions. I never knew how much diverse data you can 
            get from web analytics. It was interesting to me to not only learn 
            how to run the reports that gave me vital information about a 
            site, but also how to interpret that data and use what the data 
            has to say to make informative decisions on what should be done 
            to improve traffic, loyalty, and interactions for the site.

        <p class="internship-desc">I've been enough fortunate to have been able to work 
            remotely as an intern at a company in Iowa called Circle 
            Computer Resources. My responsibilities include accessing 
            databases, creating API endpoints, and formatting and 
            styling webpages just to name a few. I mostly work in the 
            internal webpages of the company and improve the 
            acquisition of client information for our sales team. I have 
            done a number of things throughout my time at CCR, but 
            my biggest achievement was publishing a completely new 
            interface for the client companies' dashboard. Throughout 
            this process I not only need to implement the new features, 
            but I am also creating the data link from our database to the 
            interface through an API endpoint, handling bugs, and 
            constantly testing the new features. In my job I am able to 
            get some hands-on experience with some well-written code 
            and apply the skills that I am learning in the classroom to 
            the real world.
